Data Validation Layer

Format validation: Check date formats (DOB, expiry), country codes (ISO 3166), phone/email formats, IBAN/account numbers, PAN/Aadhaar number patterns.

Cross-field consistency: DOB vs Age, Address vs Country, Expiry date vs Issue date.

Duplicate/Repetition check: Detect if the same document ID has already been uploaded.

Blacklist check: Names, phone numbers, email domains, IPs against blacklist.

Watchlist/PEP/Sanctions check: Integration with public/global watchlists (OFAC, UN lists).
